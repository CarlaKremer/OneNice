## Background Story

For as long as I can remember, I have been using the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) theme by [binaryify](https://github.com/binaryify) and I **love** it!
Its clean, minimal aesthetics really appeal to me.

Then I started using [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) and was sad to see that our beloved One Dark Pro theme was not available.
Hence, I settle on [Kognise](https://kognise.dev/)'s [Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) theme for Obsidian.

>Great theme! Really recommend using it; been using basically *forever*.

The **main** reason that I want to make this theme is because coding my editor with all the colours of *One Dark Pro* and going to *obsidian-atom* feels... "*disconnected*".
Hence, I mainly wanted to reproduce my editor's feel into Obsidian.
